This project was made in a **Team of 1** as part of the **Advanced Algorithms & Complexity** course at [Grenoble INP &ndash; Ensimag](https://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/).

## BlobWar Game

**BlobWar** is a two-player chessboard-game. On each turn, a player moves a blob either by duplicating it on an adjacent square, or jumping it two squares away without duplication. After a move, any opposing blobs on adjacent squares to the target square will change color.
